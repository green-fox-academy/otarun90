    <h1>Farkas DÃ¡niel</h1>

    <sub>Ex-tourism expert, and Fullstack software developer[wannabe]</sub>
    <p>For years I have been working in tourism, but due to the pandemic in 2020 I had too much free time (-__-).
    </p>
    <p>I finally had the chance to look into programming and as the saying goes <em>"Every cloud has a silver
        lining"</em>, and I managed to find something that I enjoy.</p>

        time
        irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>
      <h4>Programming Language</h4>
      <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.
        They
        generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific
        algorithms.</p>
      <h4>Domain Name System</h4>
      <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the
        Internet
